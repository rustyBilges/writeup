\chapter{Appendix A}
\label{app:app01}

\initial{P}edagogical approach - A significant amount of the material relating to my thesis is not contained within this physical document. Rather than using an appendix I have created a website to contain the S.M. Rather than being content substantiating the novel scientific content of my work, most of this material is supplementary in nature. However this does not make it less important...in fact very important that people understand your work, especially in an inter-disciplinary environment!..(perhaps this fits with short discussion on complexity etc.)

The relevant theory for each thesis chapter is presented on the website : (1) TN videos, (2) animations of model (3) link to github code??


\paragraph*{1. TN videos}

To include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Intro to TN and population modelling
	\item Competitive exclusion
	\item Apparent competitive
	\item Stationarity vs time scale (moving window averaging)
	\item Inferring species interactions
	\item Spatial vs non-spatial modelling (link to *)
	\item Noise induced oscialltions? (at least concept of noise)
\end{itemize}



\paragraph*{2. Animations}

To include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Basic spatial dynamics, with time series (HI and LI regimes)
	\item Mutualism (as above)
	\item Habitat destruction (a few examples)
	\item Networks (underlying versus realised) - non-linearity in FR??
	\item Spatial modelling (link to*) - simulation with small network, same one as in * Same dynamics??
\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{3. Code repo}

Possible code to be made available:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Clean version of IBM (ask Miguel)
	\item Recurrence plots and analysis (python package)
	\item Kaplan-glass test (python)
	\item Tests for chaos??
\end{itemize}
