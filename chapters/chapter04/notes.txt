Contact with Daniel this week. His main points were:

> Top predators should not eat plants (rare cases, life stages)

> Suggest running lower IR (based on a paper, and desire for extinctions?)

> Wants interaction frequencies

> In nature higher trophic levels more vulnerable to exintction (test for this?)

> Check James McCann work on Omnivory

> Discussion section, after results, link our findings with current literature (contextualise)

***************************************************************************************************

From literature overview:

> Loreau theoretical and experimental results on "propagule rain" - IR good for plant diversity, reduction in competition.
> Dispersal maintains diversity in fragemented habitats (dispersal limitation versus edge effects) - several papers on this sort of thing
> Island Biogeography theory can contextualise our model nicely. (regional species pool) Doesn not limit relevance to island systems.
> Species-area relationship (SAR)
> Importance of immigration in Barro Isalnd (Hubbel)
> Metacommunity theory: heterogenous at regional scale can provide a constant species pool for local immigration

Specific questions for Alan:

> RDSF

> Steady state analysis? See figures.

> Am I an ecologist or an engineer?

> Look at a single networks:
	+ For long vs short runs: steady state 
	+ For comparison of RADS
	+ perturbation experiements (later - stability chapter)

	How to choose an average network?

Language issues (ecology versus engineering?):

<< "On average a higher MAI ratio leads to a greater total number of individuals at the end of a simulation."

>> "On average, a higher proportion of mutualistic interactions leads to a greater total number of individuals in the community."


<< "This means that there are fewer empty landscape cells into which an individual may immigrate at random."

>> "The community is saturated to a certain extent as more individuals inhabit the landscape."
