Point to discuss:


Contact with Daniel this week. His main points were:

> Top predators should not eat plants (rare cases, life stages)

> Suggest running lower IR (based on a paper, and desire for extinctions?)

> Wants interaction frequencies (re-runs)

> In nature higher trophic levels more vulnerable to exintction (test for this)

> Check James McCann work on Omnivory

> Discussion section, after results, links our finding with current literature. (contextualise)





Specific questions for Alan:

> Steady state analysis? See figures.

> Am I an ecologist or an engineer?





Language issues (ecology versus engineering?):

<< "On average a higher MAI ratio leads to a greater total number of individuals at the end of a simulation."

>> "On average, a higher proportion of mutualistic interactions leads to a greater total number of individuals in the community."


<< "This means that there are fewer empty landscape cells into which an individual may immigrate at random."

>> "The community is saturated to a certain extent as more individuals inhabit the landscape."
