\section{Ideas for conclusion}
\label{sec:conc_ideas}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sensitivity analysis: latin hypercube
	\item SEM modelling?
	\item Use of empricial networks, or an alternative network generation method
	
	\item Departure from our results in natural communities (what might be different?) - immigration mechanism. Functional response. The way animals move!
	
	\item Other way to construct networks: Each non-overlapping pairs? Thilos GM? Stability issues? (may refer to in chapter 4 also?)
\end{itemize}





Points to read up on for viva!

\begin{itemize}
	\item All analysis methods and metrics, but in particular:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Lognormal and power law dists. \cite{mcgill2007species}
		\item Review stability concepts \cite{donohue2013dimensionality}
	\end{enumerate}		
\end{itemize}
