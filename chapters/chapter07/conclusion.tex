\section{Ideas for conclusion}
\label{sec:conc_ideas}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sensitivity analysis: latin hypercube
	\item SEM modelling?
	\item Use of empricial networks, or an alternative network generation method
	
	\item Departure from our results in natural communities (what might be different?) - immigration mechanism. Functional response. The way animals move!
\end{itemize}
