\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.2}{\ignorespaces \textbf {Nestedness} is the property that the diets of specialist species are subsets of the diets of generalist species. It is common in mutualistic communities. Figure reproduced from \cite {allesina2012ecology}: `\textbf {a}, In the mutualistic interactions that occur between plants and their pollinators, some species (generalists, such as the pink-eyed bee) interact with many partners, whereas other species (specialists, such as the blue-eyed bee) have few partners. \textbf {b}, Such networks have been described as 'nested', as they produce a triangular pattern when the interactions (depicted by black squares) are arranged in a matrix.
