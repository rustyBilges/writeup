\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Stranded polar bears on Cross Island outside Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. The plight of the polar bear has received much attention in the mdeia. The habitat loss it suffers from is very visible. However the focus of conservation strategies must be on the ecological communities, of which it is one member species.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces A representation of 1-dimensional \emph {niche space} as visualised in the original publication \cite {williams2000simple}, for number of species $S=6$. The blue traingles represent the placement of species in niche space. The niche vaule of species $i$ is given by $n_i$. The width and centre of the feeding range for species $i$ are denoted by $r_i$ and $c_i$ respectively. Species $i$ consumes all species whose niche values fall within the feeding range.}}{8}{figure.2.1}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces Schematic of an underlying interaction network (reproduced from \cite {lurgi2015effects}). Nodes correspond to species, and arrows to trophic links (antagonistic or mutualistic), from resource to consumer. The six functional groups of species are colour coded, and named in the legend. In this case there are twelve links between the first two trophic levels, six of these have been replaced by mutualistic links giving a MAI ratio of $0.5$. Mutualistic plants and animal mutualists are defined by any species that has at least one mutualistic links. However both these groups of species may also have antagonistic links.}}{10}{figure.2.2}

These plots show the results averaged over all replicates and over all MAI ratios. Solid lines indicate the mean value, and shaded areas indicate $\pm 1$ standard deviation. This metric suggests that species distributions, on average, become less aggregated in space due to random destruction. Whereas they appear to become more spatially aggregated as a result of contiguous destruction.}}{22}{figure.3.5}

This metric is the sum of the elements of the interaction frequency matrix i.e. the total number of interaction occuring within a given period of time. Solid lines indicate the mean value, and shaded areas indicate $\pm 1$ standard deviation. For contiguous destruction interactions are slighty more frequent, on average, than for random destruction.}}{23}{figure.3.6}
