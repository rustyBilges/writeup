The habitat loss it suffers from is very visible. However the focus of conservation strategies must be on the ecological communities, of which it is one member species.

The width and centre of the feeding range for species $i$ are denoted by $r_i$ and $c_i$ respectively.

Nodes correspond to species, and arrows to trophic links (antagonistic or mutualistic), from resource to consumer. The six functional groups of species are colour coded, and named in the legend. In this case there are twelve links between the first two trophic levels, six of these have been replaced by mutualistic links giving a MAI ratio of $0.5$. Mutualistic plants and animal mutualists are defined by any species that has at least one mutualistic links. However both these groups of species may also have antagonistic links.}}{10}{figure.2.2}
